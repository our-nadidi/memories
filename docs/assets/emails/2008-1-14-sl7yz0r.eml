Mein lieber Marki!

Das war so sch=C3=B6n mit Dir am Telefon gestern abend!
I did hear this morning at 06:30 that your school was closed today and I ju=
mped with you for joy!
Here the snow is pretty wet - it would be excellent to make Igloos, snowmen=
 and -balls.
Not very attractive for Snow Angels though, he wings wouldn't flutter easil=
y~~~~!
I wonder what you are doing today? Probably playing with Christina via cibe=
r space. Am I right?

I love you, mys Buebi and as I said, it was such JOY to talk with you last =
night.
Thank you so much for calling!!
Now I can picture the lay-out of your room and some of the colours (british=
 spelling) in it, except your bed and cover. You will laugh at the sketch I=
 made and hopefully will correct it when you come.

Take good care, be happy, smile your beautiful smile and have a good week!

Love and hugs and more Love,
Your
Nadidi
