Dear Marki!

To you, Mommy and Christina a big Thank You for the beautiful Flowers.
They make the room look so much brighter and let us know that Spring is around the corner.
Please give Mommy and Christina this message.

I was so happy that you all came today and you will never know how happy and proud of you I am that you fixed the Apple mail. Thank you again and again!
I look forward to reading "me" next week and again I am grateful that you share it with us. I'm certain that I will learn many things.

Today was a wonderful glass ball for me. You can ask Mommy what this means - she knows it.


We need to go to bed early tonight and sleep nine hours so we will be alert and ready to admire all those
buttery flies.

Schlafe mein Prinzchen, schlaf' ein and hugs and tousels,

Nadidi
