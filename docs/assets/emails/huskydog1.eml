Mio caro Orso Bianco,
Do you use a warm scarf all the time, especially outside when you have a =
sore throat or cough? And a cap.
If only I could help you and make you feel better!
Ramen are good and they warm you up even more than hot tea.
Just rest, rest and keep evenly warm whenever possible.
Please keep me posted on how you feel and I keep wishing you gueti gueti =
Besserig, in German, gute gute Besserung.
Best wishes and Hugs and Love,=20
Nadidi
Do you need more blankets???
