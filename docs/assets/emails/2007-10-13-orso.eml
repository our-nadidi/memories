My dear Marki

I was so very happy to hear from you and thank you for your letter I found last night.
(I appreciate me too, will very much enjoy this!) You funny bunny.

I am glad that you are enjoying your stay in Norwich and I can imagine that they can use your help with some chores. I know first hand what a good worker you are.
Do you remember how fast you took out the old Azalea in front and how the sweat ran down your face? Baba and I finally planted the Hyrangea I received from Tanti for Mothers Day in that space and
I hope that the snow will not crush it, when it crashes down from the roof.

I can't wait to hear about your New York trip and the relatives and we do hope to see you soon.

Big question now: Will the Postmaster send this letter with above hieroglyphics back to me
and tell me that this is a "permanent failure" or wonders upon wonders will it, the letter, find its way zipping through the universe shouting "Marki! Marki! Mys Buebi, Mys Buebi, Em-germency-
Em-germency, catch it, catch it! It's from your Nadidi!"
Be ready!

Actually, I have a hunch that Mr. Google is at it again and scrambled that nonsensical, unmanageable
and downright unprintable address.
Aha! That is why you never received my mail from Friday Oct 5. to marki2929.

Love and as many hugs as there are stars in the sky
from your

Nadidi
