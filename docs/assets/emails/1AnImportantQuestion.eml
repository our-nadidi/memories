Liebe Marki,

I can't believe that I'm really writing to this holy address.
Forgive me please and keep it a secret.

For more than a month I racked my brain what we could give Daddy for his =
big Birthday and=20
I need your input. Do you think he would like to have a shrub or a tree =
for the yard?
We could send him a gift certificate from Hart's Greenhouse in Norwich.
This is just an idea and please when you have some time - school comes =
first, of course - think what he would enjoy. We don't want to just send =
any old gift. I'm sure you know what I mean.
Do not tell him!

I hope very much that you feel better and that you could catch up on =
work.

Very early Saturday snow 2-3 in west to 5-10 inches in eastern CT, =
ending Sat. evening.=20
Bitterly cold winds, windchill 0 or below. Sunday blustery and cold.
So stay tucked in, in your warm cozy room with your boots ready at the =
door to go for warm meals!!!
Tues. Wed, Thurs. warmer.

This was your friendly weather service from wfsb Hartford.

I love you and miss you and send tousels galore,
Nadidi=
