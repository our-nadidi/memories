My dearest Marki

When you were little I would ask you once in a while: "This is such a wonderful day!  Why am I so very very happy?"
And you would beam and smile your beautiful smile and whisper full of confidence: "Because I'm here!"
And you were right!!!!!

I just remembered this as I read your letter that arrived today - and the letter made me very very happy!
Thank you.
I'm glad that the stamps arrived and that you all liked them.

I will squeeze my thumbs for you (the Swiss way) "HTH" for your midterm exams, but I'm sure that you are doing fine.

We miss you and hope to see you real soon.
Until then, I send YOU, mys liebe Buebi, many many Hugs and Hair-tousles.
Take good care of yourself.

Googles of LOVE,
Nadidi

P.S. Are you sure that you want to step down to Goo-Goo-Level and play Go with me?
       Ouch - ha-ha.
