Mys liebe Buebi!

Thank you sooo much for your call tonight. It was a total surprise and I am=
 very happy that you like the content of the box.
It was not at all meant to make you sad. On the contrary, it was put togeth=
er to make you happy doing crafts and keep you cozy at night (unless the el=
ephants snore too loudly or chatter with the Himelg=C3=BCegeli)  and warm y=
our tummy when you get home from school on cold afternoons.

Now we look forward to Thanksgiving and I can't wait to hear about your new=
 school.
Best best wishes for the start on Monday.

Please give my love to Jie, Daddy and precious little Isabella.

To you my dear Marki, countless big hugs and googles of Love,
Nadidi
