Dear Marki,
I read your letter and left a message on your phone. I'm so sorry that =
you had a bad week. What happened? Did you fight at school or at home?
Wherever it was, try very hard to stay calm and leave the "situation". =
Go read, do something constructive, exercise etc.
And of course --- there is always a One-lens waiting and waiting and a =
Grandmother who checks daily, holds her breath hoping to see an Igloo, a =
snowy picture and when the sunny sky appears in the west, the =
Grandmother, just like One-lens keeps waiting and waiting and w...

I just couldn't resist, and of course School comes first. You know how =
happy I am that you are doing so well.
I would love to hear details about your classes.

Today two young Polish men came in the rain to shovel the icy snow off =
the roof. I'll send you a picture of the snow heaps. They worked so hard =
and fast and reminded me of you when you used to shovel very fast and =
got all sweaty in the middle of Winter!
I love you my Orso and send lots of Tousels,
Nadidi=
