My liebe Marki!

I wish you a really good and interesting and relaxed first day of school. And the same the second day, and third etc. etc.
You will do fine, I know that. Just have confidence and do your best. You are very smart, kind, courteous and very likable and... may I say very good looking, all things most people wish they were. Believe in yourself!

Yes, one goes to school and has to learn what all the other students learn, be on time, do what the teachers say but don't forget that the learning is for your benefit, it is the foundation for your adult life.
You, dear Marki, have the gift to make a good, solid and broad foundation.
Yes one has to conform and this seems to worry you a bit, but if one didn't, the world might be chaos, trains wouldn't run on time or not run at all, the mailman could decide not to bring the mail every day, machines wouldn't be ready for delivery and the internet might take a month of vacation here and there.
All these people who are involved in above samples keep their personalities. They are all individuals, not one is the same as the other.
You will see, that you are still the Marki with all his many wonderful talents, his kind and compassionate personality and all the many good things that are there. These things will not change.

We do have to work on ourselves all through life, try just a bit harder to do a good job, be kind even to grumpy people, help where we can and try not to make too many mistakes, learn from these mistakes  and not to make the same one twice.
I speak from my own experience, made plenty of mistakes, wished to be able to take angry words back or had not put off things that needed attention etc.

My dear Marki, your Birthday card with the Cotton Topped Tamarin and the beautiful writing is very precious to me and I thank you so much for it.

And - can you believe this??!!
I just found this letter in my "Drafts" and all along I thought that you had read it before School started....

And you are doing fine and are still the same great Marki.

All my very best wishes and Tousels and Love,

Nadidi
